ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @genezeiniss 
  
I'm an experienced back-end-oriented software engineer, wine lover, and a wanderlust (which is made worse by a pandemic. Fortunately, wine is consoling).
Although my educational background includes humanitarian disciplines, I discovered a passion for technology, which led me to begin a high-tech career as an ISTQB certified QA tester, then advanced to development and software engineering. 
My professional experience includes a few years of Backend Guild leading, responsible for R&D training, technological advancement, conventions, and practices. 
Currently, I'm part of the Sensitive Data Management team, Security R&D at Fintech company. I'm also volunteering as a Co-Manager of the Tech-Blogging Program, by Baot. I'm a tech blogger and public speaker.
