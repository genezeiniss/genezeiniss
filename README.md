- 👋 Hi, I’m @genezeiniss 
  

  I'm an experienced back-end-oriented developer.
  Although my educational background includes humanitarian disciplines, I discovered a passion for technology,
  which led me to begin a high-tech career as an ISTQB certified QA tester, then advanced to development and software engineering.
  I lead the Backend Guild, responsible for R&D training, technological advancement, conventions, and practices.
  I also have a tech blog on Medium. And I'm a beginner at Public Speaking.
  I'm a wine lover and a wanderlust (which is made worse by a pandemic. Fortunately, wine is consoling).


- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kafka
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend Java / Kotlin projects
- 📫 Follow me on social media (twitter, linkedin)
